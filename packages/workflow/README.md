# @tempeh/workflow

## Overview

The `@tempeh/workflow` package provides comprehensive workflow management capabilities for the Tempeh CLI, enabling complex deployment workflows, parallel execution, rollback management, and error recovery. It orchestrates multi-step infrastructure operations with advanced features like checkpointing, parallelization, and automatic rollback.

## Intent

This package serves as the workflow orchestration foundation for the Tempeh system by:

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Managing complex multi-step deployment workflows
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabling parallel execution of independent operations
- **Rollback Management**: Providing automatic and manual rollback capabilities
- **Error Recovery**: Implementing sophisticated error recovery and retry mechanisms
- **Checkpointing**: Supporting workflow checkpointing and resumption
- **Resource Coordination**: Coordinating resource dependencies and constraints

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### WorkflowEngine (`workflow-engine.ts`)
The main workflow orchestration engine that manages workflow execution:
- **Workflow Execution**: Execute workflows with proper sequencing and dependencies
- **Workflow Validation**: Validate workflow definitions and dependencies
- **Workflow Optimization**: Optimize workflows for performance and resource usage
- **Workflow Analysis**: Analyze workflows for parallelization opportunities

#### ParallelExecutionManager (`parallel-execution-manager.ts`)
Manages parallel execution of workflow steps:
- **Dependency Analysis**: Analyze step dependencies to identify parallelizable operations
- **Concurrency Control**: Control the level of parallelism and resource usage
- **Resource Pooling**: Manage shared resources across parallel operations
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute work across available resources

#### RollbackManager (`rollback-manager.ts`)
Handles rollback operations and recovery:
- **Rollback Planning**: Plan rollback operations based on current state
- **Rollback Execution**: Execute rollback operations safely and efficiently
- **Rollback Validation**: Validate rollback results and state consistency
- **Rollback History**: Track rollback history and dependencies

#### ErrorRecovery (`error-recovery.ts`)
Implements error recovery and retry mechanisms:
- **Error Classification**: Classify errors and determine recovery strategies
- **Retry Logic**: Implement intelligent retry mechanisms with backoff
- **Error Isolation**: Isolate errors to prevent cascading failures
- **Recovery Coordination**: Coordinate recovery across multiple components

## Usage

```typescript
import { 
  WorkflowEngine, 
  ParallelExecutionManager,
  RollbackManager,
  ErrorRecovery 
} from '@tempeh/workflow';

// Initialize workflow engine
const workflowEngine = new WorkflowEngine(engine, stateManager);

// Define a workflow
const workflow = {
  name: 'production-deployment',
  description: 'Deploy to production environment',
  steps: [
    {
      name: 'validate-config',
      command: 'validate',
      dependencies: []
    },
    {
      name: 'deploy-database',
      command: 'deploy',
      dependencies: ['validate-config'],
      parallel: true
    },
    {
      name: 'deploy-application',
      command: 'deploy',
      dependencies: ['deploy-database'],
      parallel: false
    }
  ]
};

// Execute workflow
const result = await workflowEngine.executeWorkflow(workflow, {
  maxConcurrency: 3,
  enableCheckpointing: true,
  autoRollback: true
});

// Handle parallel execution
const parallelManager = new ParallelExecutionManager();
const parallelResult = await parallelManager.executeParallel(steps, {
  maxConcurrency: 5,
  resourceLimits: { cpu: 80, memory: 90 }
});

// Manage rollbacks
const rollbackManager = new RollbackManager();
await rollbackManager.planRollback(failedStep);
await rollbackManager.executeRollback(rollbackPlan);
```
